# go-grokking-algorithms
Go (Golang) code samples for Grokking Algorithm book by Aditya Y. Bhargava
## Proof of work
You can make sure it works by running tests, which are located in directory with every code sample.

Run them all at once:

`go test -count=1 -v ./...`

Run specific test suite:

`go test -count=1 -v location (e.g. ./01_BinarySearch)`
